#JSConf Tahoe Website

This is the website for JSConf Tahoe in 2018.

It is currently based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which has extremely thorough [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for building or running it locally.

There's a good chance this may eventually get switched over to something JS-based like React.
